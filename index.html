    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>The Pitty Party is a progressive political action committee for the emotionally exhausted. A place where broken-hearted idealists gather not to give up—but to regroup, rearm (with memes and policy), and go back out swinging.</p>
    <p><strong>Apathy is easy. We choose pain—on purpose. Because someone has to.</strong></p>
    <p>We are the spiritual opposite of "Hope and Change." We are <strong>Despair and Action</strong>.</p>
    <p>We’re not a think tank. We’re a <strong>feel tank</strong>.</p>
    <p><em>Misery loves company. Join the Pitty Party today.</em></p>

    <h2>Founding Story</h2>
    <p>It didn’t start with Trump. Or Biden. Or Gaza. Or Greenland.</p>
    <p>It started with a Supreme Court ruling so catastrophically stupid that even C-SPAN viewers blinked in disbelief.</p>
    <p><strong>Citizens United v. FEC, 2010.</strong><br />That was the moment the veil dropped. When the powers-that-be declared, with a straight face, that money is speech and corporations are people. And just like that, the American people became background noise in their own democracy.</p>
    <p>For years, we waited for someone—anyone—to fix it. But no one came.<br />And the problems multiplied.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Healthcare? Privatized.</li>
      <li>Education? Dismantled.</li>
      <li>Wages? Stagnant.</li>
      <li>Climate? On fire.</li>
      <li>Billionaires? Flying to space.</li>
      <li>Us? Crying into a microwaved burrito during a 15-minute lunch break.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That’s when it happened.</p>
    <p>Somewhere in Texas, a mild-mannered musician sat doomscrolling with his dog Sugar farting in his lap, nose burning from the gaseous emissions. A bad omen it was. The news was bleak. Again. Supreme Court immunity. Gaza in ruins. Greenland next on the real estate wishlist.</p>
    <p>And he thought:<br /><strong>“This country doesn’t deserve another party... at least not the kind with balloons and cake. It needs a Pitty Party.”</strong></p>

    <h2>Meet William Pitty</h2>
    <p>William Pitty is the face of the disillusioned masses. Born in a strip mall and raised on expired coupons, he’s just a guy who’s had enough. He carries a dry erase protest sign and drinks gas station coffee like it’s a sacred ritual. He is not a politician. He’s you. He’s me. He’s the reason we cry at city council meetings.</p>
